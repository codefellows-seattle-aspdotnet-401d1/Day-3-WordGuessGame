=====================================

## ReadMe
- Your readme should include the following information:

	- What did you struggle with? Why? How did you solve? I struggled with the portion of the game that tests the user's input when guessing
		random word.
	- What did you learn during this assignment? I learned about switch statements in depth and got to use one. I also learned that I could have used more than
		one switch statement.
    - What resources did you utilize for this assingment? my peers A LOT

## Directions
The directions below mock what an actual client requirements document may contain. It is your job, as a developer, to interpret these directions and 
create a program based on what is stated below.

Josie Cat has requested that a "Word Guess Game" be built. The main idea of the game is she must guess what a mystery word is by inputitng 
either (1) letter or a sequence of letters at a time. The game should save all of her guesses (both correct and incorrect) throughout each session of the game,
along with the ability to show her how many letters out of the word she has guessed correctly. 

Each time a new game session starts, the mystery word chosen should 
come from an external text file that randomly selects one of the words listed. This file should be editable by Josie so that 
she may view, add, and delete words as she wishes. She expects the game to have a simple user interface that is easy to navigate. 

Using everything you've learned and researched up to this point, create a word guess
game that will meet all of the requiements described in the user story above.
