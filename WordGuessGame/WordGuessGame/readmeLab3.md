<h1>Guess Game</h1>

<p>How long did it take you to complete this assignment?</p>
<p>I spent about over 10 hours on this but it's finally finished.</p>
<p>What did you struggle with? Why? How did you solve?</p>
<p>I tihnk i psyched myself out with the scale of the project, just getting the menu and crud operations going was arduous. Part of it is it's hard for me to not think in databases or objects.</p>
<p>I eventually overcame this by moving a ton of stuff back into main and refactoring from there.</p>
<p> 2 hours in: 188 lines of code without doing any file I/O, some good scaffolding and basic menu
    5 hours in: admin menu refactored and complete, CRUD operations working except for the single word deletion
    7 hours in: wasted a ton of time trying to figure out Regex
    9 hours in: major refactoring for the actual game logic, game menu fully working
    ??? hours in: game logic complete after major refactoring of most of the game logic into main<p>
<p>What did you learn during this assignment?</p>
<p>I learned a lot about crud operations and file I/O that I didn't know or forgot because I haven't touched it for 4 years.</p>
<p>What resources did you utilize for this assingment?</p>
<p>I relied heavily on the class lecture, demo and the readings.</p>
